## Getting Started

This project has two main parts:

- **iOS App (SwiftUI + MVVM)**  
  Performs local sentiment analysis on stock news headlines/summaries using `NLLanguage` and displays per-stock scores and keywords.  
  It also calls a backend service for LLM-based investment advice.

- **Backend (Python FastAPI + Gemma 2B with RAG)**  
  Provides additional investment advice by combining LlamaIndex-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with an open-source LLM (`gemma:2b` running via Ollama).

### 1. Backend Setup

First, make sure you have [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) installed.  
Then create a clean Python environment:

```bash
# go to backend folder
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ollama&Gemma install
brew install ollama
ollama serve            
ollama pull gemma2:2b

#Then you can run backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
#And test with new terminal
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/advice_rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"AAPL","level":"Pessimistic","keywords":["inflation","earnings"],"score":-0.3}'
```
